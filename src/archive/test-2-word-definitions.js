 * test 15: gpt-4.1-2025-04-14
 * 1 def - dryer
 * result: 15 v 1 - perfect.
 *
 * test 14: gpt-4.1-2025-04-14
 * 1 def - light
 * result: 14 v 1 - perfect.
 *
 * test 13: gpt-4.1-2025-04-14
 * 1 def - break; prompt guidelines emp. multiple definitions
 * result: as good as 10, just traded one definition for another.
 *
 * test 12: gpt-4.1-2025-04-14
 * 1 def - break; more concise prompt guidelines
 * result: as good as 10, just traded one definition for another.
 *
 * test 11: chatgpt-4o-latest
 * 1 def - break
 * result: ugh. More definitions but wonky examples again. Nope.
 *
 * test 10: chatgpt-4.1
 * 1 def - break
 * result: perfect. Wall overcame; get what you paid for.
 *
 * test 01: gpt-4o-mini
 * 3 defs - quality dropped due to excessive output?
 * tokens: i: 471 / o: 633 / t: 1104
 *
 * test 02: gpt-4o-mini
 * 1 def - see if quality improves
 * result: MIXED, slightly more output, but incorrect meanings
 *
 * test 03: gpt-4o-mini
 * 1 def - more clear instructions/safeguards
 * result: no mixed meanings, can it be improved?
 *
 * test 04: gpt-4o-mini
 * 1 def - improve tags + synonym instructions
 * result: no change in tags/synonums, meanings differ - why? = AI non-determinism
 *
 * test 05: gpt-4o-mini
 * 1 def - increase determinism, improve prompt
 * result: not as elaborate as test 1, but seems good enough
 *
 * test 06: gpt-4o-mini
 * 1 def - break
 * result: looks good, except used "broke" in example sentence; should be break!
 *
 * test 07: gpt-4o-mini
 * 1 def - break; example should use word in the same form as the definition
 * result: example uses "break", but it's incorrect!
 *
 * test 08: gpt-4o-mini
 * 1 def - break; improve prompt for better example sentences
 * result: ex. sentence good, definition is being merged, confusing
 *
 * test 09: gpt-4o-mini
 * 1 def - break; improve prompt for better defs
 * result: seems to have hit a wall. Need a new approach.

ðŸ§· Guidelines:

Clarity
- Prioritize clear, simple definitions suitable for ESL learners.
- Include synonyms or tags only if available; otherwise, omit.

Example Sentences
- Use natural, everyday language in examples.
- Sentences must use the headword in its base form.
- Do not use inflected forms (e.g. for break - broke, broken, breaking).

Word Senses
- Use consistent meanings across entries.
- Prioritize core CEFR A1, A2, B1 senses.
- List each clearly distinct meaning separately.
- If a word has only one relevant meaning, include only that.
- Do not combine unrelated or distinct senses into one definition.
- Do not repeat the same sense unless the usage is significantly different.
- Include as many distinct senses as are appropriate for ESL learners â€” whether that's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or more in rare cases.

Formatting
- Output valid JSON only â€” no extra formatting, markdown, or explanations.
