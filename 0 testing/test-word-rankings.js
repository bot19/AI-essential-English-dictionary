You are a professional Lexicographer. For the following words, provide a rank appropriate to their usage and importance in the English language for an ESL learner (think: The Ofxord 5000). The rank should be a number between 1 and 10 (inclusive), where 1 is the most essential and 10 is the least essential.

words:
1. apple
2. hello
3. direction
4. restaurant
5. dryer
6. junction
7. chef
8. you
9. operation
10. expectation

output format (JSON):
{ "word": rank, "word2": rank2, ... }

- The output is a JSON object with the words as keys and their ranks as int values. The keys should be sorted in rank order, with 1 first.
- Only output the JSON objectâ€”no explanations.
- Keep JSON clean and valid. This JSON object will be parsed by a program, so don't add any extra text or formatting.
